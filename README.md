# CarComplaints

Data collection project as a hands on demonstration using python libraries. Scrapped car sales data and car complaints data off https://carsalesbase.com/ and https://www.carcomplaints.com/.

Obtained results of matching models (brand, year, model) and divided the amount of complaints over sales amount (aggregated sorted by year). Result is a ratio number used to rank the reliability of a car. I did not use any specific statistical techniques or any algorithms to get my results, as this is more of an exercise than to find conclusive results, although some of the results are no surprises. 

To play around with the simple dashboard, use the link below.
